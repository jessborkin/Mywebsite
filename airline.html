      <u><b>COMFORT V's MONEY</u></b>
      <p>With over 700 airlines to choose from there is no specific one i would say not to fly with. Obviouly if money is no limit i would go for one of the bigger airlines such as British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines or Emirates. by doing so you are guaranteed a more enjoyable journey as you will have access to a personal in-flight entertainment system, wider seats, onboard meal and in most cases luggage will be included. If you are looking to save money you still have a ton of airlines to choose from, for example Easyjet, Ryanair and Wizzair are some of my personal favourites.. the only downside you wont have in-flight entertainment, onboard meal comes at an addtional cost and luggage is usually not included.</p>
