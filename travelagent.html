      <p>Many people think the travel agent industry is slowly dying out, to an extent that is true as we dont see many travel agents lining the streets as we used to, this is mainly because of the internet and more and more companies going digital. But let me tell you the industry is still booming most travel agents now work as an OTA(Online Travel Agent) when you book a flight or hotel via a third party website you often assume its a small company running from a small office but in actually fact most of the popular OTAs belong to global companies.</p>
      <u><b>ADVANTAGES BOOKING ONLINE YOURSELF</u></b>
      <p>-If your a corporate traveller and your planning to travel in one of the upper classes most travel agents with actul be able to find you better rates as they will have special incentives running with the bigger airlines</p>
      <p>-A travel agent will plan and book every stage of your booking and make special request as they have access to special systems</p>
